        <h1>THE ROYAL<br>TENENEBAUMS</h1>
        <h2>comedy | drama</h2>
        <p>Royal Tenenbaum and his wife Etheline had 
            three children and then they separated. All 
            three children are extraordinary --- all geniuses. 
            Virtually all memory of the brilliance of the 
            young Tenenbaums was subsequently erased 
            by two decades of betrayal, failure, and disaster. 
            Most of this was generally considered to be 
            their father's fault. "The Royal Tenenbaums" is 
            the story of the family's sudden, unexpected 
            reunion one recent winter.</p>
