            <h1>THE ROYAL<br>TENENEBAUMS</h1>
            <h2>comedy | drama</h2>
            <p>Royal Tenenbaum and his wife Etheline had 
                three children and then they separated. All 
                three children are extraordinary --- all geniuses. 
                Virtually all memory of the brilliance of the 
                young Tenenbaums was subsequently erased 
                by two decades of betrayal, failure, and disaster. 
                Most of this was generally considered to be 
                their father's fault. "The Royal Tenenbaums" is 
                the story of the family's sudden, unexpected 
                reunion one recent winter.</p>
