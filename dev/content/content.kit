            <h1>THE ROYAL<br>TENENEBAUMS</h1>
            <h2>comedy | drama</h2>
            <p>Royal Tenenbaum and his wife Etheline had 
                three children and then they separated. All 
                three children are extraordinary --- all geniuses. 
                Virtually all memory of the brilliance of the 
                young Tenenbaums was subsequently erased 
                by two decades of betrayal, failure, and disaster. 
                Most of this was generally considered to be 
                their father's fault. "The Royal Tenenbaums" is 
                the story of the family's sudden, unexpected 
                reunion one recent winter.</p>

            <h1>ISLE OF DOGS</h1>
            <h2>comedy | animation | adventure</h2>
            <p>When, by executive decree, all the canine pets 
                of Megasaki City are exiled to a vast 
                garbage-dump called Trash Island, 12-year-old 
                Atari sets off alone in a miniature Junior-Turbo 
                Prop and flies across the river in search of his 
                bodyguard-dog, Spots. There, with the 
                assistance of a pack of newly-found mongrel 
                friends, he begins an epic journey that will 
                decide the fate and future of the entire Prefecture.</p>
