                        <h2>comedy | drama</h2>
                        <p>Royal Tenenbaum and his wife Etheline had 
                            three children and then they separated. All 
                            three children are extraordinary --- all geniuses. 
                            Virtually all memory of the brilliance of the 
                            young Tenenbaums was subsequently erased 
                            by two decades of betrayal, failure, and disaster. 
                            Most of this was generally considered to be 
                            their father's fault. "The Royal Tenenbaums" is 
                            the story of the family's sudden, unexpected 
                            reunion one recent winter.</p>

                        <p>In the 1930s, the Grand Budapest Hotel is a popular European 
                            ski resort, presided over by concierge Gustave H. (Ralph 
                            Fiennes). Zero, a junior lobby boy, becomes Gustave's friend 
                            and protege. Gustave prides himself on providing first-class 
                            service to the hotel's guests, including satisfying the sexual 
                            needs of the many elderly women who stay there. When one 
                            of Gustave's lovers dies mysteriously, Gustave finds himself
                             the recipient of a priceless painting and the chief suspect 
                            in her murder.</p>
