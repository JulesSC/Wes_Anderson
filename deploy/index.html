                    <h1>THE ROYAL<br>TENENEBAUMS</h1>
                    <h2>comedy | drama</h2>
                    <p>Royal Tenenbaum and his wife Etheline had 
                        three children and then they separated. All 
                        three children are extraordinary --- all geniuses. 
                        Virtually all memory of the brilliance of the 
                        young Tenenbaums was subsequently erased 
                        by two decades of betrayal, failure, and disaster. 
                        Most of this was generally considered to be 
                        their father's fault. "The Royal Tenenbaums" is 
                        the story of the family's sudden, unexpected 
                        reunion one recent winter.</p>

                    <h2>comedy | animation | adventure</h2>
                    <p>When, by executive decree, all the canine pets 
                        of Megasaki City are exiled to a vast 
                        garbage-dump called Trash Island, 12-year-old 
                        Atari sets off alone in a miniature Junior-Turbo 
                        Prop and flies across the river in search of his 
                        bodyguard-dog, Spots. There, with the 
                        assistance of a pack of newly-found mongrel 
                        friends, he begins an epic journey that will 
                        decide the fate and future of the entire Prefecture.</p>
